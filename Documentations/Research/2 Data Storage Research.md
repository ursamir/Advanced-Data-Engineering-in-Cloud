# Comparative Research on Data Storage Technologies

## Introduction

This document provides a comparative analysis of various data storage technologies suitable for storing datasets ranging from 10MB to 100GB.

## Criteria for Comparison

- **Scalability:** Ability to handle datasets of varying sizes.
- **Performance:** Speed of data retrieval and storage operations.
- **Cost:** Initial setup costs and ongoing maintenance expenses.
- **Ease of Use:** Complexity of setup, configuration, and management.
- **Features:** Additional functionalities such as ACID compliance, replication, and sharding.

## Comparison Table

| Technology         | Scalability           | Performance            | Cost                  | Ease of Use           | Features                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Relational Databases (e.g., MySQL)** | Good for structured data | Fast for indexed queries | Moderate              | Widely understood, SQL language | ACID compliance, transactions |
| **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)** | Scalable for unstructured data | High read/write speeds | Moderate              | Flexible schema design  | Replication, sharding      |
| **Hadoop HDFS**    | Highly scalable        | Parallel processing    | Low (software is free, hardware costs vary) | Complex setup, requires Hadoop ecosystem knowledge | Fault tolerance, distributed computing |
| **Amazon S3**       | Infinitely scalable    | High read/write speeds | Pay-as-you-go pricing | Easy to use, managed service | Object storage, durability |
| **Redis**           | Scalable for caching   | Extremely fast         | Moderate              | In-memory data store   | Key-value store, pub/sub   |
| **SQLite**          | Good for embedded apps | Fast read access       | Low                   | Zero-configuration, file-based | ACID compliance, single-file database |

## Recommendation

Based on the analysis:
- For small to medium-sized datasets (up to 10GB), consider **SQLite** for its simplicity and low setup cost.
- For larger datasets (more than 10GB), **MongoDB** or **Amazon S3** are recommended depending on whether structured querying or unstructured data storage is required.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right data storage technology depends on the specific requirements of your application, including data size, performance needs, scalability, and budget constraints.
